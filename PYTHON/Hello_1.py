# To create a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python, you can use the `print()` function to display the text. Here's the basic "Hello, World!" program in Python:

# ```python
# print("Hello, World!")
# ```

# To run this program, follow these steps:

# 1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.
# 2. Enter the above code into a new file.
# 3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello.py`.
# 4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
# 5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `hello.py` file.
# 6. Run the program by typing `python hello.py` and pressing Enter.

# You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal.

# This is the most basic Python program, and it's often used as an introductory example to demonstrate the syntax of the language.


print("Hello");
# This signal line comment
'''This is multiline comment'''

username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
