# Python Fundamentals

This repository provides an overview of fundamental programming concepts in Python. These concepts are essential for understanding how Python works and how to write Python programs effectively.

## Variables

Variables are used to store and reference data in Python programs. They follow specific naming rules and can hold various data types. Key points about variables:

- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore and can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Descriptive variable names following Python naming conventions are recommended.
- Variables can hold integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, and more.

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of elements in Python, and they allow duplicate values. Key points about lists:

- Lists are defined using square brackets [].
- Elements can be accessed by index.
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents.
- Common list methods include `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and more.

## Tuples

Tuples are ordered and immutable collections of elements in Python. Key points about tuples:

- Tuples are defined using parentheses ().
- Elements can be accessed by index.
- Tuples are immutable; their elements cannot be modified.
- Common tuple methods include `count()` and `index()`.

## Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements in Python. Key points about sets:

- Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the `set()` constructor.
- Elements can be added and removed from sets.
- Sets support set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Common set methods include `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, and more.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs in Python. Key points about dictionaries:

- Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}.
- Elements are accessed by keys, not indices.
- Dictionaries are mutable; you can change their contents.
- Common dictionary methods include `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`.

## Loops

Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. Key points about loops:

- `for` loops iterate over sequences or iterable objects.
- `while` loops execute code as long as a condition is True.
- You can control loops with `break`, `continue`, and `else` statements.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize your code and make it more modular. Key points about functions:

- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.
- Functions can have parameters and return values.
- You can use anonymous functions (lambda functions) for simple operations.
- Functions can be documented using docstrings for clarity.

## Conditionals

Conditional statements in Python (e.g., `if`, `elif`, `else`) allow you to control the flow of your program based on specific conditions. Key points about conditionals:

- `if` statements execute code when a condition is True.
- `elif` statements check multiple conditions.
- `else` statements provide a fallback when no conditions are True.
- Python follows the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) scope for variable resolution in conditionals.

## Classes and Objects

Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Python supports OOP and allows you to define classes and create objects from them. Key points about classes and objects:

- Classes define blueprints for objects.
- Objects are instances of classes.
- Classes have attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
- You can use inheritance to create new classes based on existing ones.

## Set in Python

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the `set()` constructor. Key points about sets:

- Sets do not allow duplicate values.
- You can perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Sets are useful for tasks involving unique elements.

## Tuple in Python

A tuple is an ordered and immutable collection of elements. Tuples are defined using parentheses (). Key points about tuples:

- Tuples do not allow modification of elements after creation.
- Tuples can be used for representing fixed data.
- Tuple packing and unpacking allow for concise code.
